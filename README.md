**Guest**: Review the topic and outline provided by the host. Prepare any points or anecdotes you’d like to share.

# Technical Setup:

**Guest** ensure you have a reliable microphone, headphones, and a stable internet connection.
Test your equipment before the recording to avoid technical issues.

Choose a quiet place for recording. Minimize background noise by turning off notifications, alarms, and other potential interruptions.
Inform others in your space that you are recording to avoid disturbances.

**Recording Quality**:

Use headphones to prevent audio feedback.
Position the microphone correctly to capture clear audio. Speak clearly and at a consistent volume.

2. Respect the host’s direction and questions.
3. If you do go off-topic, the host should gently guide the conversation back.

**Respectful Communication**:

1. Listen actively and avoid interrupting the host or other guests.
2. Use respectful language and tone, even when discussing controversial topics.

**Clarity and Brevity**:

**Review and Feedback**:

Hosts should inform guests about the editing process and if they can review the final cut before it goes live.
Provide feedback to each other to improve future episodes.
